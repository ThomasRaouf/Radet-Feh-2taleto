These are the the needed files for running "Radet Feh 2taleto" Game, download and run main.py using a compiler (like VSCode) to try out the game :D

This minigame was created for the "Hackclub Counterspell Giza" game jam in 
about 4.5 hours with no prior game coding experience (so please excuse any bugs! XD). 
It includes only one demo level.
